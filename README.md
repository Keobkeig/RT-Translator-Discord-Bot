# RT-Translator-Discord-Bot
A Discord bot that is able to translate a user's messages as they're being sent. Intended to help users communicate with each other on global servers. 


(2023.7.2) - I could not continue this project due to translator API limitations(word and request limits due to the free model). The installation of an open-source translator (LibreTranslate) resulted in numerous errors, and I did not know how to resolve them. However, the commands were working before I hit the limit and I had learned a lot about using discord.js, using APIs in projects, and gained experience with Node.js in general.
